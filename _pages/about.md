* I am a Research Scientist at Facebook AI. Prior to this, I am a Senior Applied Scientist at Microsoft Cloud and AI. I got my Ph.D. from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu), where I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.cse.msu.edu) lead by Professor [Xiaoming Liu](https://cse.msu.edu/~liuxm/index2.html). In 2013, I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn).

* I am broadly interested in computer vision and deep learning. My research areas are mainly focused on face-based reasoning including face detection, face recognition, face image generation; large-scale object detection, vision and language pre-training for image-text retrieval and image captioning, and etc.
